    <p>Done correctly, a classic tiramisù can be transcendent. A creamy dessert of espresso-soaked ladyfingers surrounded by lightly sweetened whipped cream and a rich mascarpone, tiramisù relies heavily on the quality of its ingredients.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ cup/100 grams granulated sugar, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup/227 grams mascarpone (8 ounces)</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups good espresso or very strong coffee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rum or cognac</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>About 24 ladyfingers (from one 7-ounce/200-gram package)</li>
        <li>1 to 2 ounces bittersweet chocolate, for shaving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <h3>Step 1:</h3>
    <p>Using an electric mixer in a medium bowl, whip together egg yolks and 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until very pale yellow and about tripled in volume. A slight ribbon should fall from the beaters (or whisk attachment) when lifted from the bowl. Transfer mixture to a large bowl, wiping out the medium bowl used to whip the yolks and set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 2:</h3>
    <p>In the medium bowl, whip cream and remaining 1/4 cup/50 grams sugar until it creates soft-medium peaks. Add mascarpone and continue to whip until it creates a soft, spreadable mixture with medium peaks. Gently fold the mascarpone mixture into the sweetened egg yolks until combined.</p>
    <h3>Step 3:</h3>
    <p>Combine espresso and rum in a shallow bowl and set aside.</p>
    <h3>Step 4:</h3>
    <p>Using a sifter, dust the bottom of a 2-quart baking dish (an 8x8-inch dish, or a 9-inch round cake pan would also work here) with 1 tablespoon cocoa powder.</p>
    <h3>Step 5:</h3>
    <p>Working one at a time, quickly dip each ladyfinger into the espresso mixture -- they are quite porous and will fall apart if left in the liquid too long -- and place them rounded side up at the bottom of the baking dish.</p>
    <h3>Step 6:</h3>
    <p>Dust top layer with remaining tablespoon of cocoa powder. Top with shaved or finely grated chocolate, if desired.</p>
    <h3>Step 7:</h3>
    <p>Cover with plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours (if you can wait 24 hours, all the better) before slicing or scooping to serve.</p>
